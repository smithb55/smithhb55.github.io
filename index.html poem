        <p>Para<br><br><br><strong>ings</strong></p>
         <h2>yesterday I was at the beach soaking in the sun</h2>
         <h3>I was eating a hot and a seagull stole the bun</h3>
         <h4>even though the seagull took the bun I was still having fun</h4>
         <h5>after me and my brother ate we went for a run</h5>
         <h6>after the run I put on more lotion</h6>
         <p>then I went for a swim in the ocean</p>
         <p>after swimming we played paddle ball</p>
         <p>then we saw a dolphin and it was small</p>
         <p>then we saw people playing volleyball </p>
         <p>the people playing were very tall</p>
